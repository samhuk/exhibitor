## Overview

Exhibitor is a [React](https://react.dev/) component workshop - a tool for creating React component libraries. It allows you to see your front-end components (or pages) in a hot-reloading website whilst you create them, with the ability to tweak their props and test them in a variety of domains such as accessibility, responsiveness, and automated end-to-end testing.

[See the live demo](https://demo.exhibitor.dev)!

## Usage Overview

Exhibitor is simple to setup. It can be added to an existing React codebase that contains components or be used to bootstrap one from scratch. See the [Exhibitor Wiki](https://github.com/samhuk/exhibitor/wiki) for more information.

If you already have React components, using Exhibitor is as easy as this:

```
npm install --save-dev exhibitor react react-dom
```

Create exhibitions of your components:

```typescript
// src/button.exh.ts (or .js, .jsx, .tsx, ...)
import exhibit, { simpleTextInputModifier } from 'exhibitor'
import Button from './button' // I.e. button.tsx

exhibit(Button, 'Button')
  // Define any default props
  .defaults({
    color: 'default',
  })
  // Define which props are events of the component
  .events({ onClick: true })
  // Define miscellaneous options
  .options({ group: 'Final Review' })
  // Define how props can be tweaked
  .propModifiers([
    simpleTextInputModifier('textContent'),
  ])
  // Define variants with different prop values
  .variant('Green', defaultProps => ({
    ...defaultProps,
    color: 'green',
  }))
  // Group variants together
  .group('Large', ex => ex
    .defaults(p => {
      ...p,
      size: 'large'
    })
    .variant('Green', p => {
      ...p,
      color: 'green'
    }))
  .build()
```

Start exhibitor:

```
npx exhibitor start
```
