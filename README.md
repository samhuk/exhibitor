## Overview

exhibitor is an extremely fast React component workshop, using Go and esbuild.

The main goal of exhibitor is to continue the Javascript tooling revolution started by esbuild, creating a delightful zen-like component workshop along the way.

## Major Features

* Extremely fast
* Simple
* Sane defaults
* e2e testing integration (puppeteer?)
* Beautiful Javascript API with Typescript-centric design for zero guesswork.

## Development
